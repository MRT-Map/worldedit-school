# //undo and //redo

Similar to `Ctrl+Z` and `Ctrl+Y`/`Ctrl+Shift+Z`, //undo and //redo can undo and redo operations.

It optionally accepts a number representing the number of operations to undo or redo. For example, `//undo 5` undoes 5 operations.

Note that there is usually a limit on the number of operations that you can undo or redo.

<div class="warning">

Be careful not to accidentally undo operations in another place that you wouldn't notice immediately! Clear your history with `//clearhistory` if needed.
</div>
