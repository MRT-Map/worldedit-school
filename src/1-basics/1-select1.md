# Selection 1 (//wand, p1/p2)

Most WorldEdit operations require a selection in the world. One way of selecting an area is by using a wand.

## The Wand

If the conductor is doing the w/e for you, you can skip this section.

`//wand` gives you a wand, which by default is a wooden axe. Using the wand, left-click sets p1 and right-click sets p2.

## Positions

The default selection is cuboid, and hence requires two points on opposite sides, p1 and p2.

You can select the points with the wand as shown in the section above. If a conductor is helping you, see below.

<div class="warning">
    If a conductor is helping you with w/e:
    * Mark p1 and p2 with clear blocks, eg. diamond in a white build
    * Show the conductor where the points are
        * Stand next to the points and say "p1" or "p2"
        * if they're near, you can also say the material, eg. "points on diamond"
    * Tell the conductor the operations to run
</div>

More selection types and methods are covered [here](../2-intermediate/select.md).
