# /tool tree and /tool deltree

`/tool tree`, or `/tree` lets you plant trees without using saplings. **It can be done without a conductor and a selection.**

First hold a non-placeable item and run `/tool tree <name>`, for example `/tool tree oak`. Then right-click somewhere to plant.

<div class="warning">
    Two trees may be placed; in this case you can run //undo once.
</div>

`/tool deltree`, or `/deltree` removes **floating** trees. After binding it to an item, right-click a floating tree to remove it. You can make a tree floating by removing the bottom-most log block and removing leaves that touch other structures.

To remove the tooling from an item, do `/tool unbind`.
