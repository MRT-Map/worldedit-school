# //stack

`//stack` stacks the selection in a particular direction, and is essentially the faster way of pasting a section individually.

It is also your favourite command, good luck with Mojangitis lol

You need to give it the number of times to stack, and the direction to stack. For example, `//stack 5 u` stacks the selection upwards 5 times.

It also supports the following flags:
* `-a` is like in `//paste`, to prevent the air in the selection from being stacked in the stacked sections.
* `-m <mask>` to only stack certain blocks.
* `-e` to also stack entities.
* `-s` to shift the selection to the last section stacked.

More about `//stack` is covered in TODO.
