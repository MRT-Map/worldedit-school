# Liquids (//drain, //fixwater, //fixlava)

These are some commands useful for dealing with water and lava.

`//drain` removes water and lava within a radius. For example, `//drain 50` removes all water and lava within 50 blocks of the player. Adding `-w` also removes the waterlog from blocks.

`//fixwater` and `//fixlava` replace flowing water or lava with their still versions within a radius. For example, `//fixwater 50` fixes water within 50 blocks of the player.
